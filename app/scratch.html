<p><em>Microenterprise & Private Enterprise Promotion Office</em></p><br><p>As the contract holder of KDMD and the project’s flagship program, the Microenterprise Development Office (now part of the Microenterprise and Private Enterprise Promotion Office, or MPEP) pioneered many activities that KDMD now supports across USAID. Building on previous work under USAID's Accelerated Microenterprise Advancement Project, KDMD was designed to provide a knowledge-driven approach to microenterprise development by extending and multiplying the impact of the learning and innovation. On behalf of MPEP, KDMD managed Microlinks, an online community of microenterprise development practitioners as well as a number of products and activities such as the Connections newsletter, Notes From the Field, specialized seminar series, online events and exchanges, learning network facilitation, online courses and tools like the Value Chain Development Wiki, among many others. Over the life of the project, KDMD has revolutionized the way development practitioners connect with each other, significantly influencing how knowledge management is understood across the Agency.</p><br><p><em>Private Enterprise</em></p><br><p>With the creation of USAID’s Microenterprise and Private Enterprise Promotion Office, the Private Enterprise team was formed. Concurrently, KDMD began support for the launch of the Women’s Leadership in Small & Medium Enterprise (WLSME) initiative in May 2012. While funding was set aside to support pilot interventions in the field, KDMD created products and managed activities to facilitate learning among the project teams and the wider practitioner community around gender and enterprise development. Building on KDMD’s past experience, the WLSME online community was developed. The site houses knowledge generated from a seminar series, original research analysis, online events, and lessons learned among project implementers. KDMD also began supporting various knowledge sharing activities for the Private Enterprise team as it thought through its strategic approach to private sector engagement. KDMD provided services to help the team communicate its approach to private sector engagement and connect with stakeholders to further the discussion.</p><br><p><em>Grants Under Contract</em></p><br><p>Through its work with USAID’s former Microenterprise Development Office and continuing under the current Microenterprise and Private Enterprise Promotion Office, KDMD administered grant funds over the life of the project in support of the Office’s objectives to generate new research, pilot innovative approaches, facilitate knowledge exchange, and offer short-term technical assistance to further the practice of microenterprise development. As part of the grant agreements, organizations participated in various KDMD-managed learning networks, knowledge sharing events, and evaluation activities. Administering and managing the grant program also allowed KDMD to assess implications of adaptive management in relation to contracting mechanisms.</p><br><p><em>Office of Development Credit</em></p><p>KDMD’s support to USAID’s Development Credit Authority began in February 2010, serving to backstop the Office’s partial credit guarantee programs and promote a learning-oriented environment aimed at maximizing USAID’s efforts to stimulate local growth in over 70 countries around the world. KDMD managed monitoring and reporting on guarantee performance, risk assessments to identify the potential for loan defaults to the U.S. Government, and state-of-the-art communications and knowledge management approaches.</p><br><p><em>Bureau for Food Security</em></p><p>Through its work with USAID’s Bureau for Food Security, KDMD helped develop and grow the knowledge base of agriculture and agriculture‐led food security approaches by capturing lessons learned from the field using cutting-edge techniques. Since October 2009, the project has been improving knowledge flows within Bureau, between the Bureau and others across the Agency, and with partners. KDMD was the architect of Agrilinks, a vibrant and robust source of knowledge and activities related to agriculture and agriculture‐led food security. The project created innovative learning and engagement opportunities for this community, such as reinventing the Ag Sector Council Seminar Series, the eUpdate newsletter, #AskAg TwitterChats, AgExchanges, Video Notes, and a number of training-related activities. In April 2011, KDMD and the Bureau started work with the U.S. Government’s Feed the Future (FTF) program by holding in-person stakeholder meetings, sharing knowledge, and designing the FTF award-winning website.</p><br><p><em>Office of Economic Policy</em></p><br><p>Since 2009, KDMD has been working with USAID’s Economic Policy Office (formerly known as the Economic Growth Office) to expand their training program to meet an increase in the Office’s workforce. KDMD promoted a blended learning approach, which combines in-person and online interaction to drive the highest learning impact. By applying blended approaches, KDMD could better provide USAID staff with a continuous learning experience, extending learning before, during, and after a workshop or training.</p><br><p><em>Office of Innovation and Development Alliances</em></p><p>In December 2011, the KDMD team proposed a knowledge management and facilitation strategy for USAID’s Office of Innovation and Development Alliance’s Mobile Solutions team based on a needs-assessment exercise conducted with members of the team and staff from four pilot Missions: Haiti, Afghanistan, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The goal of the knowledge management activities was to facilitate behavior change at the Mission level to improve and scale up mobile programming while making the Mobile Solutions team's model of support to Missions sustainable and scalable. To achieve this, the KDMD helped to identify and share lessons learned, resources, and technical gaps through peer-to-peer knowledge exchange.</p><br><p><em>Global Partnerships Office</em></p><p>In early 2011, KDMD developed and implemented the first-ever, in-person training under the former USAID Office of Developing Partners (now the Global Partnerships team within the Office of Innovation and Development Alliances). In May 2012, KDMD continued its support through the development of an online course, planned as a prerequisite to the team’s in-person trainings, to serve as an introduction to developing partnerships at USAID for all staff.</p><br><p><em>Bureau for Policy, Planning, and Learning</em></p><p>In 2011, USAID’s Bureau for Policy, Planning, and Learning (PPL) approached KDMD to support its efforts in developing an Agency-wide learning strategy; raising awareness around collaborating, learning, and adapting (CLA) throughout the Program Cycle; stakeholder engagement; and strategic planning support to Missions. KDMD conducted an early baseline assessment of learning at USAID, which informed subsequent activities to facilitate more systematic and intentional learning. KDMD’s seminal achievement for PPL was the launch of USAID’s Learning Lab website. The fully customized, online platform was designed to maximize knowledge sharing among USAID and its partners. To better understand how CLA fits into the development agenda, KDMD managed online events, small-group clinics, focus groups, and other outreach activities. To infuse the conversation with the latest thinking in organizational learning as well as evaluation, KDMD implemented various seminar series and workshops, convened a community of practice, and developed innovative knowledge products.</p><br><p><em>USAID/Jamaica</em></p><p>Since 2009, KDMD assisted USAID/Jamaica in designing, managing, and implementing the Jamaica Partners for Educational Progress Community of Practice (CoP), a country-level community focused on improving basic education and early grade literacy in the country. The CoP originally started as a network of education professionals and stakeholders who collaborated virtually and in person to share knowledge, discuss critical issues, and provide peer support. In addition to building a website to serve as the CoP hub, KDMD rolled out a series of core CoP products and activities, including EduExchange online discussions, EduFocus publications, and a community newsletter. In June 2013, KDMD facilitated the successful transition of the management of the CoP from USAID/Jamaica to the University of the West Indies, a local academic institution in the Caribbean that was well-prepared to assume ownership of the newly expanded Caribbean Partners for Educational Progress Community of Practice.
