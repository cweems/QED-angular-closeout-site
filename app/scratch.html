          Since the KDMD project officially began in 2008, data collection processes have significantly evolved and expanded over the years. The authors of this report used as many sources as possible to synthesize the project’s accomplishments, but they also acknowledge that in many cases, data was not available in all years for all programs. In order to illustrate the broad scope of KDMD’s work, the calculation of metrics across this report used a robust mixture of methods, tools and resources. The following is an illustrative list of some methods and tools used:
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Activity reports</li>
          <li>Google Analytics</li>
          <li>Surveys with staff and other stakeholders</li>
          <li>Project billing/staffing records</li>
          <li>USAID University Training Course Enrollment Data</li>
          <li>Adobe Connect analytics</li>
          <li>After Action Review records</li>
          <li>KDMD Training Sign in Sheets</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Due to incomplete datasets, not all activities were uniformly documented with the same tools, resulting in some missing data points. In the case of missing data for a documented activity, an average across other similar activities was used as a proxy in the calculation of these overall metrics.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          This final report was produced for review by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Knowledge-Driven Microenterprise Development (KDMD) project, implemented by the QED Group LLC (Contract #EEM-C00-08-00004-00).
