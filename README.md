#KDMD Close Out Site

This website was created for the USAID Knowledge-Driven Microenterprise Project and is inspired by annualreport-2011.kiva.org.

##For Dan:

Because the final Semi-Annual Report wasn't ready at the time this site went live, I made a placeholder PDF file. In the site files go to app/img/documents/ then replace 10_SAR.pdf with a file of the same name.

##Primary features of the site include:

* Ability to load a large amount of content in an orderly manner.
* Navigation in a sidebar, "next" buttons, and search.
* Organize a variety of content into a cohesive set of information.

This site was built using AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap.
